# This script is used to launch sbt on developer workstations. It will *NOT* 
# work on the Jenkins build servers, which should use the sbt4jenkins script
# instead.  

# The sbt launcher bootstraps itself by downloading its dependencies (jna,
# Scala, sbt itself) from the Maven Central and org.scala-tools repositories.
# To reduce build time, the script configures the launcher to retrieve these
# dependencies from caches on Netflix's Artifactory instance. This is done by
# providing the launcher with an sbt.boot.properties file that overrides the
# default repositories: 

# -Dsbt.boot.properties=sbt.boot.properties
